**Addressed component of the system :**
Addresses the data processing and reporting component of the heat pump monitoring system.
Focuses on retrieving administrative system data, fetching configuration and feed data, and calculating and outputting key performance metrics, such as heat energy output and efficiency percentages.

**Impact Gained from Analysis :**
Dependencies between modules like user_model, system_model, and database operations are identified, ensuring changes in one area like feed structure are accounted for across the script.
The script heavily relies on remote APIs such as file_get_contents for feed data. If the remote API structure changes or becomes unavailable, key components like S10: Fetch feed metadata or S11: Fetch feed data will fail.
Specific points of failure, such as missing configuration (S8: if (heat pump data available)) or unexpected feed data values, are highlighted, aiding maintainability and debugging.
